# Project Specific Stuff

This is basically so that I can do [drag and drop](https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview) and it honestly looks simpler than React for this singular
purpose.

Literally all I want the frontend to do, for as long as possible, is just send events to the rust thingy through a socket.
